**3D Animation Class: Assignment 0**

# [Three.js/Blender Template](https://joerhoney.github.io/threejs-blender/)

## Objective

- Maintain a working Three.js template

## Tools

- Blender (topic of this class)
- Three.js (not part of this class)

## Notes

- This is based on a 3D Animation class I am attending at Santiago Canyon College in Orange, CA.
- I embellished this work beyond the scope of the original assignment, just to give it more appeal. For instance, materials, backgrounds and lighting were not allowed. The model had to be submitted in default gray with nothing but the geometry.
